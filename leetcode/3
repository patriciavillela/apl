⍝ Explaining to enhance understanding
⍝ 
⍝ 1. First we generate every substring that starts at the beginning of the string
⍝    Ex. 'abc' becomes 'a', 'ab' and 'abc'
⍝ 2. For each we do the following procedure
⍝ 2.1. Reverse it (this is done because the substrings are created from start to finish, so the future "OR sweep" step needs to be done backwards)
⍝ 2.2. Create a unique mask
⍝ 2.3. OR sweep
⍝ 2.4. Sum reduce
⍝ 3. Get the bigger of those results
